>> What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?

It creates a hidden file called .git which will contain the versions of the files in the repository. Initialization is important because it tells git which directory we want to use VC in.

>> How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository? What value do you think it offers?

The staging area works between the working directory and the repository. The staging area is where files get added before they get commited. It allows the user to choose which files to commit and in what order.
